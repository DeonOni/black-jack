## 🎮 How to Play
- Start the game by typing s  
- You will receive two random cards, the dealer also gets two (one is hidden)  
- Choose whether to:
  - draw → take another card
  - pass → let the dealer play
- If your total goes over 21, you bust and lose immediately  
- The dealer draws cards until reaching at least 19
- Whoever is closer to 21 without going over wins
